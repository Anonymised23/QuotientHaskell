INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR QUOTIENT HASKELL
==============================================

1. Download/Clone the Quotient Haskell repository; there is no need to install Liquid Haskell separately, as this directory includes all of the Liquid Haskell source.
   
2. Ensure that you have installed the z3 SMT solver (this is required to compile code with Liquid Haskell)
   - You can use brew with Mac, though Rosetta is necessary for M1/M2 architectures
   - Otherwise, just follow the instructions at https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3

3. Follow the Liquid Haskell build instructions found in the README of the Quotient Haskell repository
